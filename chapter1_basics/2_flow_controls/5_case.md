# Flow control: case

```ruby
age = 20

case
when age >= 20
  puts "Greater 20"
when age > 30
  puts "You're getting older XD"
when 1 == 0
  puts "This is always wrong!!!"
else
  puts "The rest of cases"
end
```

##Â Short version

```ruby
age = 20

case
  puts "You're 20" when age == 20
  puts "You're older than 30" when age > 30
end
```
